  2,621,392<br />
  A nice even figure<br />
  That's the number of <a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/410304131161391105/435155160268800010/Franz_Bardon_-_Initiation_Into_Hermetics.pdf" id="hermetics">babies</a> who will be born next year, in The United States<br />
  118,481 - will <a href="http://download1653.mediafire.com/2jp8hxo41beg/gv87tno84s031b6/nagu-asi.png">die</a> before reaching their first birthday<br />
  Oh well, what's a few <a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/410304131161391105/435155160268800010/Franz_Bardon_-_Initiation_Into_Hermetics.pdf" id="hermetics">babies</a> more or less?<br />
  We've got lots of <a href="hermetics.html" id="hermetics">babies!</a><br />
  It really doesn't matter if one baby lives or dies<br />
  Well, Good Morning John!<br />
  This is John Emmerson Jones Jr.<br />
  Well, here's one reason<br />
  Looks harmless, doesn't it?<br />
  Or we could do away with all <a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/410304131161391105/435155160268800010/Franz_Bardon_-_Initiation_Into_Hermetics.pdf" id="hermetics">babies</a><br />
  But, there must be a better answer than that<br />
  This is where I come into the picture - Your Local Health Officer - and my staff<br />
  Part of our job is to clean up just such unsanitary conditions<br />
  Well, John, we got over that one alright, didn't we?<br />
  Maybe you'll get to be a year old yet!<br />
  But you've still got some very tough customers to meet on the path of your life<br />
  That's where your local health officer - That's Me! - comes back into the picture<br />

  You see, Johnny, most immunizations should be completed before you become one year old<br />
  Does that surprise you?<br />
  Are you sure?<br />
  Let's be really sure<br />
  Step in for just a couple of minutes<br />
  Now don't worry, John, it's a very simple process for you<br />
  And I know <a href="../../src/video/basic new folder.zip" id="hermetics">[Unintelligible]</a> won't mind it either<br />
  It's not so simple for your blood though<br />
  Let's see what happens<br />
  [Unintelligible]<br />
  Time will tell!<br />
  But there's one thing you do have to worry about, John<br />
  And now that you're a family man, you've got to face it<br />
  A local health department is costing you<br />
  Yes, John, it's costing you real money<br />
  3Â¢ a week!<br />
  "Tires Screech"<br />
  That's right<br />
  There's the old ticker pumping away<br />
  More skin area, more pounds of flesh, and more pipe needed to cover the ground<br />
<br />
  By royal staffed health departments throughout this great country of ours<br />
<br />
  Which kind of Public Health service does your community have?<br />
<br />
  Anything we can do for you now... John?<br />
<br />
  Aren't you lucky that you happen to live in a community that has a Health Department?<br />
